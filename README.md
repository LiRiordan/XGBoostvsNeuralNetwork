# XGBoostvsNeuralNetwork
Program written for comparing XGBoost and NN in learning a given function

This was written for a presentation given at the Heilbronn doctoral programme summer school in 2022.
We were aiming to justify our use of XGBoost in a project over a Neural Network. Unfortunately the graphs showed the opposite.

Some potential reasons for this might be, our data was sometimes discrete whereas the program above uses continuous functions, or also that I have no idea
how to tune the parameters of XGBoost. Could also have been that the Neural network was trained or the entire train journey (no pun intended) from Bath to Edinburgh whereas
xgboost was given the journey from the train to the accomodation to learn this.

Never-the-less I found it a useful project for learning some ML techniques and occasionally look back on it to remind myself of how to do things (though I'm sure it contains
many many errors and is not efficient).
